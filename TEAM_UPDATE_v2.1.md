## Hi Team! 👋

Excited to share that **InvestmentIQ v2.1** is now live with major data accuracy improvements and confirmed 100% live data integration across all agents!

## 🎯 What's New in v2.1

### Critical Bug Fixes
We discovered and fixed several data mapping issues that were causing incorrect metric displays:

1. **✅ Debt-to-Equity Ratio** - Fixed field mapping bug
   - **Before:** Showed 0 (incorrect)
   - **After:** Shows real values (e.g., AAPL = 2.09)

2. **✅ Return on Equity (ROE)** - Implemented DuPont formula calculation
   - Formula: `Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage`
   - **Before:** Showed 0 (field didn't exist in API)
   - **After:** Shows calculated values (e.g., AAPL = 164.59%)

3. **✅ Revenue Growth** - Creative YoY calculation
   - Calculates from year-over-year `revenuePerShare` comparison
   - **Before:** Showed 0 (premium API feature)
   - **After:** Shows calculated values (e.g., AAPL = 4.68%)

4. **✅ Upside Potential** - Fixed percentage formatting
   - **Before:** -94.82% (double conversion bug)
   - **After:** -0.95% (correct)

### UI Improvements
- **📊 Analyst Counts** - Now display with comma separators for readability
  - Example: `1,522` instead of `1522`

### Live Data Verification
Thoroughly tested and confirmed **100% live data** from all sources:
- ✅ **Financial Analyst:** FMP financial ratios
- ✅ **Market Intelligence:** FMP analyst ratings & price targets
- ✅ **Qualitative Signal:** EODHD news articles
