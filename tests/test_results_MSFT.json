The ratio is 889/41 = ~21.7. This is a strong indicator.\n2. **Evaluate Price Target:** The average price target ($620.09) is significantly higher than the current price ($524.85), indicating an upside potential of 18.1%. This suggests analysts believe the stock is undervalued and will likely increase in price.\n3. **Overall Sentiment:** Combine ratings and price target information to arrive at a sentiment score. The very high buy-sell ratio and substantial upside potential push the sentiment score towards the positive end of the spectrum. A score of 0.75 reflects this strongly positive, but not perfect, consensus. I slightly reduced the score from the absolute maximum of 1.0 to account for the presence of hold and sell ratings.\n4. **Confidence Level:** My confidence is high (0.85) because the buy-sell ratio is very strong and the price target indicates significant upside.",

The unemployment rate of 4.3% is also relatively low, suggesting a healthy labor market. The federal funds rate at 4.22% poses a moderate risk, as it could increase borrowing costs for the company. Given sector performance is 0.00% and we don't have data vs S&P500, it doesn't significantly impact the overall sentiment in either a positive or negative way, therefore i weight the macro-economic factors more.",
