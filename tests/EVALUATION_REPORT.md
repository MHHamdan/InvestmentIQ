## 🚧 Limitations Identified

### 1. **API Rate Limits**
- **Gemini**: 10 requests/minute (free tier)
- **FMP**: 250 requests/day
- **Impact**: 4/7 stocks hit quota, defaulted to HOLD

### 2. **Fallback Strategy**
- Current fallback returns neutral (0.0) when APIs fail
- Better approach: Use cached historical data or last known analysis

### 3. **Directional Accuracy**
- Current: 57.1%
- Target: ≥70%
- **Root Cause**: API quota failures causing false neutrals

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate (v2.1)
1. ✅ **Implement retry logic** with exponential backoff for Gemini API
2. ✅ **Better fallback**: Use historical avg instead of 0.0
3. ✅ **Rate limiting**: Add delays between stock analyses

### Short-term (v2.2)
4. ✅ **Upgrade Gemini tier** for higher quota (or use multiple keys)
5. ✅ **Cache results**: Store previous analysis for 24hrs
6. ✅ **Batch processing**: Analyze multiple stocks with optimized API calls

### Long-term (v3.0)
7. ✅ **Fine-tune model**: Train lightweight model on historical predictions
8. ✅ **Ensemble approach**: Combine multiple LLMs for redundancy
9. ✅ **Real-time validation**: Compare predictions vs. actual price movement

## ✅ Conclusion

InvestmentIQ v2.0 shows **promising accuracy** on stocks with full API access (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA all correct), but suffers from **API quota limitations** affecting 57% of test cases.

**Next Steps**:
1. Address rate limiting issues
2. Improve fallback strategy
3. Re-evaluate with full API access
4. Target: 80%+ accuracy across all metrics

**Recommendation**: System is **production-ready for demo** but requires quota management for production use.
