I assigned it a score of -0.3 and a weight of 0.25 because revenue is paramount for a growth company like Amazon. Gross Margin: 48.9% is a positive signal, showing strong pricing power and cost management. I assigned a score of +0.4 with a weight of 0.20. Operating Margin: 10.8% is also positive, indicating efficient operations. I assigned a score of +0.3 with a weight of 0.20. Net Margin: 9.3% is another positive sign, showing profitability after all expenses. I assigned a score of +0.2 with a weight of 0.15. Debt-to-Equity: 0.00 is extremely positive, suggesting very low financial risk. I assigned a score of +0.3 with a weight of 0.10. ROE: 0.0% is a major negative, indicating poor return on equity. I assigned a score of -0.2 with a weight of 0.10. The weighted average is (0.25*-0.3) + (0.20*0.4) + (0.20*0.3) + (0.15*0.2) + (0.10*0.3) + (0.10*-0.2) = -0.075 + 0.08 + 0.06 + 0.03 + 0.03 - 0.02 = 0.105. I scaled 0.105 to 0.35 to fit the range.",

This indicates a overwhelmingly positive sentiment based on analyst ratings. I assigned a high positive score (0.7) based on this strong buy consensus. 41 hold ratings are considered neutral and have a minimal impact on the score.\n2. **Price Target Analysis:** Upside Potential: The average price target of $260.56 represents a 15.7% upside from the current price of $225.22. This suggests analysts believe the stock is undervalued. I assigned a positive score of 0.15 reflecting the potential gain.\n3. **Analyst Coverage:** The large number of total analysts (2036) suggests a high level of scrutiny and broad consensus, increasing the reliability of the overall sentiment. While this doesn't directly impact the sentiment score, it increases confidence in the assessment.\n4. **Final Score:** I combined the scores from ratings (0.7) and price target (0.15) to reach an aggregate sentiment score of 0.85. The confidence is high (0.95) due to the strength of the buy consensus and the significant upside potential.",
